## Creating Pages Dynamically
---
## Team Pages
### Step 1: Adding images...

To add images, 
<br>
1. Save your image something easy, like `firstName.jpg`. We will need to reference this in the Markdown file to get the image to be passed in!
2. [Click here](https://github.com/movetocan/move-to-canada/tree/main/src/images/headshots) to go to the project's `headshots` folder.
3. Click `Add File`.
![Add File](https://i.ibb.co/G0gYnB9/Screen-Shot-2021-06-27-at-7-14-48-PM.png)
Simply click `Add File`, and `create new file` to get started!
4. Click `Upload File`.
5. Choose a file to upload.
6. Fill out the form to make a commit:
 ![Adding Commit](https://i.ibb.co/sHZVKsN/Screen-Shot-2021-06-27-at-7-24-25-PM.png)
 - First input field: A brief message. `Add image for ____`
 - ensure `Commit directly to the main branch` is selected.
 - click `Commit Changes`
7. Now let's move on to filling out the template!


### Adding Markdown File To Pass in Data
1. You can create pages dynamically by simply adding a Markdown file titled `firstName-lastName.md` to [this folder](https://github.com/movetocan/move-to-canada/tree/main/src/pages/our-team)
2. Click `Add File`, and `create new file` to get started! ![Add File](https://i.ibb.co/G0gYnB9/Screen-Shot-2021-06-27-at-7-14-48-PM.png)

3. Write your file name. This should ALWAYS be `firstName-lastName.md`. e.g. `nick-zarlenga.md` will create a page accessible at **movetocanada.com/nick-zarlenga**
![File Name](https://i.ibb.co/DzFVKb2/Screen-Shot-2021-06-27-at-7-17-16-PM.png)

4. Paste below template, and edit fields according to the team member.
<br>

 **Please** copy template exactly as you see it, or it will not work.

### Editing the template:

Be mindful not to delete any ---'s or "s in the template! They are very important. The website will break if you delete them.

`date:` Today's date, in YYYY-MM-DD format.
<br>
`pageType:` leave as 'team'
<br>
`name:` 'First Last'
<br>
`jobTitle:` 'Job Title Here'
<br>
`location:` 'Location, HR'
<br>
`featuredImage:` 
'../../images/headshots/**change-this-to-image-path.jpg**'
<br>
scroll to see how to add images...
<br>
`tags:` ['ideal for SEO', 'can be a few words long', 'must be separated by commas', 'and between square brackets']
<br>
Your paragraphs go here!
<br>
<br>
Your paragraphs should be separated by the two `<br/> <br/>` This ensures all spacing on the web page will be the same throughout.

Finally, fill out the form to make a commit:
 ![Adding Commit](https://i.ibb.co/sHZVKsN/Screen-Shot-2021-06-27-at-7-24-25-PM.png)
 - First input field: A brief message. `Add team bio for ____`
 - ensure `Commit directly to the main branch` is selected.
 - click `Commit Changes`

Once you commit changes, they are sent to Netlify to deploy automatically. The changes should be visible within a few minutes. You can always sign in to Netlify using the credentials I gave you to see the status of the build!
