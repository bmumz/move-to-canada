          questionnaires and forms you complete, and other information you
          provide directly to us, including by email or in conversation with our
          lawyers, consultants and staff.  In addition, we obtain personal
          information from third- party sources, such as former employers,
          educational institutions you attended, relocation companies, and your
          current or prospective employer.  We use this information to provide
          immigration consulting and legal services, including analyzing,
          completing and processing immigration, visa and related filings and
          submissions to relevant government agencies, providing legal and
          consultative advice as to eligibility to obtain immigration benefits,

        `In many instances such as visa extensions, permanent residency, and
          other cases related to changes in employment, the services we provide

          legitimate interest to do so that is not overridden by your data
          protection rights as required by law, such as assisting in the
          management and administration of our clients’ global mobility programs
          (such as visa expiration tracking, immigration program compliance,
          etc.), providing access to online case- management tools, where
          applicable, and analyzing immigration trends, such as visa processing
          times and government approval rates. Where we are engaged by your
          employer, we process your personal information because it is in our
          legitimate interests to do so in order to fulfil our contract with
          your employer for client services.`,

      sovereignty, national security, and the regulation of the local
      employment market. Certain categories of personal information may be
      considered “sensitive” and are subject to a higher level of data

      about certain sensitive information in order to provide legal or
      consultative advice as to your eligibility to travel to or obtain an
      immigration benefit from a specific country. For instance, we may need
      to ask whether you have been previously convicted of any criminal
      offenses, have certain political affiliations, or other personal
      matters when the local applicable immigration laws would require such
      data for purposes of preparing an application or petition on your
