      {
        question: `Do I Need to Work with an Immigration Lawyer or Can I Work with a
              Consultant Instead?`,
        answer: `Immigration is a very complex field of law where changes can happen overnight, and decisions can
              be life-changing. Because of this, it is crucial for the person representing the applicant to have a
              solid knowledge of legal issues. Lawyers have gone through many years of law school and are
              qualified to find the best solution to suit your needs, while consultants do not have the same level of
              legal training. Immigration lawyers are experts in this field of law and furthermore, all lawyers on the
              Move to Canada Team are Certified Specialists in Citizenship and Immigration – designated as the
              best in the country.`,
      },
      {
        question: `What is a Certified Specialist in Citizenship and Immigration?`,
        answer: `This designation is the highest possible recognition awarded to immigration lawyers who have
              maintained exemplary standards of professional practice, specialize in Canadian Citizenship and
              Immigration, and are recognized as the very best in the country. In Toronto for example, there are
              only 52 citizenship and immigration lawyers who hold this designation. All immigration lawyers on
              the Move to Canada Team are Certified Specialists in Citizenship and Immigration.`,
      },
      {
        question: `Do you Guarantee my Application will be Approved?`,
        answer: `This is difficult to comment upon until your case is assessed. You can be assured that our team of
              lawyers have likely handled a case similar to yours. Anyone who provides a guarantee of approval
              ahead of time is misrepresenting themselves. As knowledgeable lawyers, our team provides
              solutions to clients that have the best chance of success – we will even let you know before you
              begin the process whether your application has a good chance of being accepted or not. We must
              confirm the particulars of your case before we can give you the specifics.`,
      },
      {
        question: `How long will it take to approve my Canadian Immigration application?`,
        answer: `The duration of the application process will depend on the type of application, the circumstances,
              and how many applications the Government is processing. It must be noted that there is no hard
              and fast rule for processing times. The Move to Canada Team’s immigration lawyers carefully
              analyze all documentation provided by clients and prepares professional presentations that save
              time for visa officers, providing them with an incentive to process your application faster and avoid
              unnecessary delays.`,
      },

      {
        question: `How do I obtain Canadian citizenship after becoming a Permanent
            Resident?`,
        answer: `If a person has been physically present in Canada for a period of at least three years within the five
            years prior to submitting the citizenship application, he/she may qualify for Canadian citizenship.
            However, the rules for calculating a period of residency are complex and there are exceptions to the
            standard residency requirement. Therefore, we strongly suggest that you call our office for
            consultation.`,
      },
      {
        question: `What rights will I have when I am a Canadian Permanent Resident?`,
        answer: `Canadian Permanent Residents have almost all of the same rights of Canadian citizens. The rights
              they do not have, are the right to vote, be elected, or hold a Canadian passport. The rights that
              Permanent residents do have, are the right to free health care, education, employment, grants,
              social assistance and other benefits depending on their circumstances.`,

      {
        question: `How Much Does it Cost to Hire a Real Estate Agent in Canada?`,
        answer: `Real Estate agents in Canada are paid upon closing of a real estate transaction, and are paid a
                percentage of the transaction value. In Canada, the Seller of the real estate is responsible to pay all
                real estate agent commissions, both for the seller’s agent, and the buyer’s agent as well. This
                means that buyers do not pay anything to hire a real estate agent in Canada.`,
      },
      {
        question: `If I Do Not Hire A Real Estate Agent, will I save money on my Purchase?`,
        answer: `No. When a buyer purchases real estate without a Real Estate Agent, the seller’s Real Estate Agent
                will be paid both the buyer’s agent commission fee, and the seller’s agent commission fee; this is
                known as double-ending a deal. There are no savings for a Buyer to purchase real estate without a
                real estate agent, and in fact this decision will likely cost the buyer more money as they do not have
                a real estate professional representing them in negotiations.`,
      },
      {
        question: `What are the costs associated with buying real estate in Canada?`,
        answer: `Real Estate in Canada, like elsewhere in the world, carries a number of costs. In Canada, these
          costs include:`,
        list: [
          `Property Tax`,
          `Utility costs (electricity, natural gas, water)`,
          `Maintenance costs for general upkeep`,
          `Mortgage payments in the case that financing was required for the purchase`,
          `Land Transfer Tax (depending on where in Canada the real estate is purchased)`,
          `The Non Resident Speculation Tax (depending on where in Canada the real estate is
            purchased), for buyers without a Canadian Permanent Residency or Canadian Citizenship.`,
        ],
