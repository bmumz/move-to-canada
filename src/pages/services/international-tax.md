In Canada, depending on the province and city within each province, international purchasers of real estate may be subject to a Non-Resident Speculation Tax. Purchasers of real estate will also be subject to a sales tax upon purchase, as well as ongoing property taxes during their ownership of the property, which will vary by city.
<br/>
There are many ways to mitigate these taxes, and the International Tax professionals on The Move to Canada Team are specifically equipped to assist our clients with these issues.
